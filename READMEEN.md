## Benchmarking

 It is important to learn and understand how to benchmark properly and what tools are appropriate for a given task, as you will need to conduct your own experiments throughout the guide to help guide your decisions (e.g., about the settings used, performance scaling checks) rather than applying settings blindly.

- **[FrameView](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/frameview)** - My personal opinion: it's a garbage app. Besides the fact that it gives a noticeable load when testing, but it can also cause statters, sagging indicators and much more.
- **[PresentMon](https://boringboredom.github.io/Frame-Time-Analysis)** - A large number of metrics, coupled with  **[Frame Time Analysis](https://boringboredom.github.io/Frame-Time-Analysis/)**. Full list of usage command and more **[here](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/blob/main/README-CaptureApplication.md#metric-definitions)**.
- **[Windows Performance Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt)** - Advanced Interrupt analysis for Windows. Measure ISR/DPC execution times with [xperf](/files/xperf-test-script.bat)
- **[Mouse Tester](https://github.com/amitxv/MouseTester)** - Check polling interval, frequency your mouse, learn about sensitivity stability 
- **[NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/reflex-latency-analyzer-360hz-g-sync-monitors)** - End-to-end latency
- **[Frame-Time-Analysis](https://boringboredom.github.io/Frame-Time-Analysis)** - Analyze CSV data logged by the programs mentioned above including 1%, 0.1% lows metrics
- **[Reflex Latency Analyzer Grapher](https://boringboredom.github.io/tools/nvidialatencygrapher)** - Analyze latency results from RLA and FrameView
